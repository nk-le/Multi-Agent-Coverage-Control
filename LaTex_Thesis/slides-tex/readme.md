# LaTeX thesis git

## Basics
Before downloading / cloning this git or even worse - directly starting with your TeX-_code_,
please take a step back and have a look at our guidelines, tutorials and best-practise examples:

 - [wiki - latex hints](https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/info/latex_hints) 
 - [Best practice for thesis writing - staff version] (https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/groups/murola/thesiswriting)
 - [Best practice for thesis writing - student version] (https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/thesiswriting_students)
 - [internal repo wiki](https://git.lsr.ei.tum.de/general/latex-student-thesis-template/wikis/home) __not up to date__
 
If you do not have LaTeX installed yet, please check either the [link above at our wiki](https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/info/latex_hints) or the 
[installation-page](https://git.lsr.ei.tum.de/general/latex-student-thesis-template/wikis/installation).
In case you do not/ cannot install LaTex, [TUM's version of Sharelatex](https://sharelatex.tum.de) is an alternative for you, but __ASK YOUR SUPERVISOR FIRST, IF HE IS FINE WITH THAT!!__
 
After Downloading / cloning this repo please be aware of __reading through the included tutorials carefully__ as it 
directly depicts a majority of the most common problems but also errors when struggling with LaTeX.

## Hints for intermediate to advanced LaTeX-users
These pages might be of a help for you
- [Use of English Titles] (http://www.tum.de/fileadmin/w00bfo/www/Studium/Dokumente/Pruefungsangelegenheiten/Verwendung_des_Englischen_in_Thesistiteln.pdf)
- [Latex Symbol Finder](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
- [Bibliography-style-comparison] (https://de.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibtex_bibliography_styles)
- [Online equation editor](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) for fast eqation checks / compilation
 
For 16:9 ratio simply use `\documentclass[aspectratio=169]{beamer}`. This works fine with the template

 

## Last but not least
 1. __Do spellcheck__
 2. Do additional checks by having a look on some guidelines, e.g. in our [wiki](https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/thesiswriting_students)
 3. __If you did not do 1., you will not get any feedback from your supervisor!__
