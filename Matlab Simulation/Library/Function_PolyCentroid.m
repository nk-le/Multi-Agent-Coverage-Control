function [Cx,Cy] = Function_PolyCentroid(X,Y)
% POLYCENTROID returns the coordinates for the centroid of polygon with vertices X,Y
% The centroid of a non-self-intersecting closed polygon defined by n vertices (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ..., (xn?1,yn?1) is the point (Cx, Cy), where
% In these formulas, the vertices are assumed to be numbered in order of their occurrence along the polygon's perimeter, and the vertex ( xn, yn ) is assumed to be the same as ( x0, y0 ). Note that if the points are numbered in clockwise order the area A, computed as above, will have a negative sign; but the centroid coordinates will be correct even in this case.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid
% A = polyarea(X,Y)

Xa = [X(2:end);X(1)];
Ya = [Y(2:end);Y(1)];

A = 1/2*sum(X.*Ya-Xa.*Y); %signed area of the polygon

Cx = (1/(6*A)*sum((X + Xa).*(X.*Ya-Xa.*Y)));
Cy = (1/(6*A)*sum((Y + Ya).*(X.*Ya-Xa.*Y)));
